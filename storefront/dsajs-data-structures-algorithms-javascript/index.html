        <h2>
          Why Algorithms?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Simply put, algorithms are several steps to solve a specific problem (e.g., sort number, search value,
          transform data, etc.). Algorithms are an essential toolbox for every programmer. Even if you don't realize it,
          you use them every day. They are built-in in apps, programming languages, and libraries. However, to make use
          of them properly, you have to know the tradeoffs so you can choose the best tool for the job.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this course, you are going to learn:

            Started reading the book, the most through the comp sci dive in. But man, It feels nice to think about the

            <p>
              I originally graduated as Electronics engineer (2008) but what I really loved was programming. So, I
              started
              learning by self to code and I was able to build websites and use web frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can get by with basic programming knowledge in most small companies. However, If you want to go next
              level
              and work with code deployed globally, where every millisecond counts, then you will benefit greatly having
              DSA
              under your tool-belt. When there's a bottleneck, you have to go under the hood and make some tweaks. For
              that,
              you need to know the core concepts of algorithms and know when to use a data structure over the other.
              Most
              small companies don't touch algorithmic concepts, but big tech companies that run code with millions of
              users
              do care about it.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </div>

        <p>
          When you interview with top tech companies, you will be expected up with algorithmic solutions on the spot.
          Even if you know how to solve the problem, 45 minutes is not enough time. So, you have to prepare for it
          beforehand and have concepts clear on your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why I decided to change that, and I spent years studying algorithms and went back to school to get M.S.
          in Software (2012), but you don't have to. I realized school doesn't prepare you to think quickly on your feet
          and also sometimes goes too deep into theoretical concepts that are barely useful. You have to put the effort
          and keep learning and practicing on your own.
          This material is streamlined. It covers the fundamental concepts to help you improve your problem-solving skills. This is what I wished I had when I started.

          Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
        </h2>

        <!-- <details>
          <summary>Is this book for me?</summary>
          <p>
            If you are familiar with JavaScript, then this is for you!
          </p>
        </details> -->

        <details>
          <summary>How would I apply these to my day-to-day work?</summary>
          <p>
            As a programmer, we have to solve problems every day. If you want to solve problems well, then it's good to
            know about a broad range of solutions. A lot of times, it's more efficient to learn existing resources than
            stumble upon the answer yourself. The more tools and practice you have, the better. This book helps you
            understand the tradeoffs among data structures and reason about algorithms performance.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How many pages does this book have?</summary>
          <p>
            The Data Structure and Algorithms in JavaScript book has 181 pages.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What topics cover the book?</summary>
          <p>
            This book explain classical Data Structures and Algorithms and how to implement them using JavaScript. In the process, you‚Äôll
            learn some fundamental computer science concepts as well. We‚Äôll build these from scratch using JavaScript,
            but what we learn can be taken and used in any other language, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will learn how to build: queues, stacks, linked lists, graphs, and trees. You‚Äôll learn to implement
            several different sorting algorithms: bubble, insert, merge, and quick. Each of these lessons will not only
            teach you their implementation, but the tradeoffs made in choosing one over another. Also, you‚Äôll learn
            about concepts like Big O notation.
          </p>
          <p>To sum up, this book covers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Big O notation:  will help you compare different solutions</li>
            <li>Arrays and lists: the most common data structures</li>
            <li>Stacks and queues: more complex list-like data structures</li>
            <li>Linked lists: how they overcome the shortcomings of arrays</li>
            <li>Maps: storing data as key-value pairs</li>
            <li>Hashing: suitable for quick insertion and retrieval</li>
            <li>Sets: useful for storing unique elements that appear only once</li>
            <li>Binary Trees: storing data in a hierarchical manner</li>
            <li>Graphs and graph algorithms: ideal for modeling networks</li>
            <li>Algorithms: including those that help you sort and search data</li>
            <li>Advanced algorithms: dynamic programming and greedy algorithms</li>
          </ul>

        <details>
          <summary>Do I need to be an advanced JavaScript programmer to understand this course?</summary>
          <p>
            No. This course assumes about basic JavaScript experience, no more. We have side notes for every time we use
            the newer JavaScript (ES6+) syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            NO experience with data structures or computer science needed!
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Why are the examples in JavaScript?</summary>
          <p>
            There are not many books about Algorithms in JavaScript. This book fills the gap. Also, the concepts in this
            book apply to any programming language. Some algorithms books even use pseudo-code but providing real
            programming examples; it's more beneficial.
          </p>

        <details>
          <summary>What is the format of this book?</summary>
          <p>
            This book is currently available on PDF (180+ pages), ePub and Mobi.
          </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Will this course continue to be updated? And will I get access to future versions?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes, there's always room for improvement, and this course will keep getting better. You will have access to
            the updated versions.

            Yes. All course participants receive access to a Slack channel where you can discuss problems and
            solutions. I'll be sitting on that channel most of the day. Helping you get better is my job.

            <p>
              Think about it this way - If this course helps you improve your programming skills, and because of
              that you help your company to solve problems more efficiently, get a promotion or land a job in a big tech
              company, would that make it worth it? Oh yeah, so take action now! üí™
