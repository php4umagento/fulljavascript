        Started reading the book, the most thorough computer science dive in. But man, It feels nice to think about the
        problems in the language I work with most regularly. Can be so hard to read some of these books and understand
        the concepts when also trying to wrap your head around a language you don't know.

          <p>
            I originally graduated as Electronics engineer (2008) but what I really loved was programming. So, I started
            learning by self to code and I was able to build websites and use web frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
              You can get by with basic programming knowledge in most small companies. However, If you want to go next level
              and work with code deployed globally, where every millisecond counts, then you will benefit greatly having DSA
              under your tool-belt. When there's a bottle neck you have to go under the hood and make some tweaks. For that,
              you need to know the core concepts of algorithms and know when to use a data structure over the other. Most
              small companies don't touch algorithmic concepts, but big tech companies that runs code with millions of users
              do care about it.
            </p>
        </aside>
      </div>


        <p>
          When you interview with top tech companies, you will be expected up with algorithmic solutions on the spot.
          Even if you know how to solve the problem, 45 minutes is not enough time. So, you have to prepare for it
          before hand and have concepts clear on your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why I decided to change that and I spent years studying algorithms and went back to school to get M.S.
          in Software (2012) but you don't have to. I realized school doesn't prepare you to think quickly on your feet
          and also sometimes goes too deep into theoretical concepts that are barely useful. You have to put the effort
          and keep learning and practicing on your own. This material is steam-lined with fundamental concepts to help
          you improve your problem solving skills. This is what I wished I had when I started.

      <h2>
        Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
      </h2>

      <details>
        <summary>Is this book for me?</summary>
        <p>
          If you are familiar with JavaScript, then this is for you!
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many algorithms books in other languages like Java, Python, C/C++ but not many in JavaScript. And
          you don't want to learn algorithms and another at the same time.
        </p>

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why are the examples in JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>
          There are not many books about Algorithms in JavaScript. This book fills the gap. Also, the concepts in this
          book apply to any programming language. Some algorithms books even use pseudo-code but providing real
          programming examples; it's more beneficial.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How would I apply these to my day-to-day work?</summary>
        <p>
          As a programmer, we have to solve problems every day. If you want to solve problems well, then it's good to
          know about a broad range of solutions. A lot of times, it's more efficient to learn existing resources than
          stumble upon the answer yourself. The more tools and practice you have, the better. This book helps you
          understand the tradeoffs among data structures and reason about algorithms performance.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What topics cover the book?</summary>
        <p>
          This course teaches you how to implement your first data structures and algorithms. In the process, you‚Äôll
          learn some fundamental computer science concepts as well. We‚Äôll build these from scratch using JavaScript,
          but what we learn can be taken and used in any other language, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will learn how to build: queues, stacks, linked lists, graphs, and trees. You‚Äôll learn to implement
          several different sorting algorithms: bubble, insert, merge, and quick. Each of these lessons will not only
          teach you their implementation, but the tradeoffs made in choosing one over another. Also, you‚Äôll learn
          about concepts like Big O notation.
        </p>
        <p>To sum up, this book covers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Big O notation:</strong>&nbsp; will help you compare different solutions</li>
          <li><strong>Arrays and lists:</strong>&nbsp;the most common data structures</li>
          <li><strong>Stacks and queues:</strong>&nbsp;more complex list-like data structures</li>
          <li><strong>Linked lists:</strong>&nbsp;how they overcome the shortcomings of arrays</li>
          <li><strong>Maps:</strong>&nbsp;storing data as key-value pairs</li>
          <li><strong>Hashing:</strong>&nbsp;suitable for quick insertion and retrieval</li>
          <li><strong>Sets:</strong>&nbsp;useful for storing unique elements that appear only once</li>
          <li><strong>Binary Trees:</strong>&nbsp;storing data in a hierarchical manner</li>
          <li><strong>Graphs and graph algorithms:</strong>&nbsp;ideal for modeling networks</li>
          <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong>&nbsp;including those that help you sort and search data</li>
          <li><strong>Advanced algorithms:</strong>&nbsp;dynamic programming and greedy algorithms</li>
        </ul>

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Is there anyone I can contact during the course if I have questions about something in particular?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Yes. All course participants receive access to a private Slack channel where you can discuss problems and
          solutions. I'll be sitting on that channel most of the day. Helping you get better is my job.
        </p>
      </details>


      <details>
        <summary>Will this course continue to be updated? And will I get access to future versions?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes, there's always room for improvement, and this course will keep getting better. You will have access to
          the updated versions.
        </p>
      </details>


      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to be an advanced JavaScript programmer to understand this course?</summary>
        <p>
          No. This course assumes about basic JavaScript experience, no more. We have side notes for every time we use
          the newer JavaScript (ES6+) syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
          NO experience with data structures or computer science needed!
        </p>
      </details>


      <details>
        <summary>I can't afford this course!</summary>
        <p>
          Really? Think about it this way - If this course helps you improve your programming skills, and because of
          that you help your company to solve problems more efficiently, get a promotion or land a job in a big tech
          company, would that make it worth it? Oh yeah, so take action now! üí™
