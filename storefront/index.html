        <h2>DSA.js FAQ</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt>Why JavaScript?</dt>
          <dd>There are many algorithms books in other languages like Java, Python, C/C++ but not many in JavaScript.
            This book fills the gap. Also, the concepts in this book are applicable to any programming language. Some
            algorithms books even use pseudo-code but providing real programming examples it's more beneficial.</dd>

          <dt>How would I apply these to my day-to-day work?</dt>
          <dd>As a programmer, we have to solve problems every day. The more tools and practice you have the better.
            This book helps you understand the tradeoffs among data structures and reason about algorithms performance.
